Postmortem for Web Stack Debugging #3

Issue Summary
Duration of the Outage:

Start Time: June 8, 2024, 09:00 AM UTC
End Time: June 8, 2024, 10:30 AM UTC
Impact:

The website hosted on the LAMP stack was completely down, returning a 500 Internal Server Error.
Users were unable to access any content on the website.
Approximately 100% of the users were affected as the entire website was non-functional.
Root Cause:

The root cause was a missing wp-config.php file, which is essential for WordPress to connect to the database and operate correctly.
Timeline
09:00 AM UTC: Issue detected by automated monitoring system alerting the DevOps team of a 500 Internal Server Error.
09:05 AM UTC: Initial investigation began by checking Apache logs and server status.
09:10 AM UTC: Verified the error by sending an HTTP request to 127.0.0.1, confirming the 500 error.
09:15 AM UTC: Attached strace to the Apache process to trace system calls and signals.
09:20 AM UTC: Identified missing wp-config.php file as the likely cause from strace output.
09:25 AM UTC: Investigated potential reasons for the missing configuration file.
09:30 AM UTC: Escalated to the WordPress support team for confirmation and advice on configuration.
09:45 AM UTC: Decided on the resolution approach: recreating the wp-config.php file.
10:00 AM UTC: Created and applied a Puppet manifest to automate the creation of the wp-config.php file.
10:15 AM UTC: Verified the fix by sending HTTP requests to 127.0.0.1, which returned a 200 OK status.
10:30 AM UTC: Confirmed that the website was back online and fully operational.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:

The wp-config.php file, which contains critical configuration settings for the WordPress site, was missing from the server. This file includes database connection details and other essential parameters required for WordPress to function. Without this file, WordPress could not connect to the database, resulting in a 500 Internal Server Error.
Resolution:

Created a Puppet manifest (0-strace_is_your_friend.pp) to ensure the wp-config.php file is present with the correct permissions and configuration.
The Puppet manifest included:
puppet
Copy code
file { '/var/www/html/wp-config.php':
  ensure  => file,
  owner   => 'www-data',
  group   => 'www-data',
  mode    => '0644',
  content => template('wordpress/wp-config.php.erb'),
}

service { 'apache2':
  ensure => running,
  enable => true,
}
Applied the Puppet manifest, which recreated the wp-config.php file and ensured the Apache service was running.
Verified the fix by confirming that HTTP requests to the server returned a 200 OK status.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements/Fixes:

Implement monitoring for critical configuration files to detect and alert on missing or corrupted files.
Enhance logging to provide more detailed error messages when critical files are missing.
Regularly backup configuration files to prevent downtime due to accidental deletion or corruption.
Task List:

Add Monitoring: Implement file integrity monitoring on the server to watch for changes to wp-config.php and other critical files.
Improve Logging: Enhance Apache and WordPress logging to capture detailed information on configuration issues.
Automate Backups: Set up automated backups of critical configuration files and databases.
Documentation: Update documentation to include steps for diagnosing and resolving common configuration issues.
Review and Audit: Conduct regular audits of server configurations to ensure compliance with best practices.
